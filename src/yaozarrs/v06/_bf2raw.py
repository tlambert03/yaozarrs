    The bioformats2raw layout was added in v0.4 as a transitional specification to
    specify filesets that already exist in the wild. An upcoming NGFF specification will
    replace this layout with explicit metadata.

    This model is a transitional spec for representing multi-position image collections
    in OME-NGFF v0.6. It is currently the only way to represent multi-position image
    collections. It also has a recommended place for OME-XML metadata.
